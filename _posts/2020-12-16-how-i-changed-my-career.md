### The beginning

Last year I was working as a crew member in a restaurant in London and I decided to change my career path to something more interesting, more challanging, something which helps me to follow my desire. I was thinking what I really like,
because I like travelling a lot and I also like to shoot photos, but I also like information technology (IT). This time I had a short visit in Budapest, where I visited my brother and I was telling him that I was thinking 
to change my career. He asked me what will be my next career path and I told him, I would like to become a programmer. He looked at me with uncertainty and said <cite>"A Programmer?"</cite> and I said <cite>"Yes, a programmer"</cite>. To understand, what was
my background connected to the IT at that time, I can tell you that I had a misconception of what is hardware and what is software. What really helped me to start this journey and to become trully persistent it was a strong friendship and 
a brotherhood. After I returned back to London, I sit down in front of my laptop and thinking, <cite>"Where to start in IT?"</cite>
