Iâ€™m a software developer, and I specialize in efficient java and python applications that works smoothly across all platforms. I care deeply about building rich GUI(Graphical User Interfaces) that are usable and pleasant for most of the users based on their experience.
My professional life has been changed many times through my past years, but I always had a passion for design, structure and digital illustration. When I was a kid I used to edit images for my frineds and I was building websites in Notepad. Later I went to study Fine Arts in Partium Chrisian University, where I made great digital illustrations and I also learned how to shot great photos. Unfortunatelly I could not finish, because I had no money to pay my bills and that made me to move to London.
Here I used to work mostly in food and hospitality what I did not regret it because I had enough free time to travel around the world. This helped me to realise what I really want to do in my life and I started to study from books java and as a tool I used Android Studio to create awesome android mobile applications.
After almost 5 years I moved Budapest to be close to my family and friends and since then I started to study python as well, because I've got high interest in Artificial Intelligence. I really want to create projects which helps to automate boring stuff around.
